# Duolingo Answer Enhancer

A proof of concept firefox browser extension.

This extension encourages active thinking by prompting the user to attempt to catch their own mistakes instead of outright accepting wrong answers and immediately displaying the corrected answer.

Normally Duolingo accepts answers containing typos and missing accents. Incorrect word forms often also get falsely flagged as a typo. This extension also prevents these from being accepted outright.
