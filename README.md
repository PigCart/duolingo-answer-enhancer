# Duolingo Answer Enhancer

Firefox extension for Duolingo that provides an extra hint and automatically increases difficulty.

Normally Duolingo accepts answers containing typos and missing accents. Occasionally incorrect word forms can also get falsely flagged as a typo. This extension forces you to attempt to identify and correct these errors yourself.

## Features
- **Extra hint:** Allows for one extra opportunity to correct a wrong answer on submission, providing a letter hint indicating a single character that needs to be added/changed or removed.

- **Automatic increased difficulty:** When available, automatically switches "token tap" and "complete translation" challenges to regular keyboard input translation challenges.
